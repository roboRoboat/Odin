    <h1>February 3, 2022</h1>

    <p>
        I've spent most of my spare time the last few days playing Noita instead of coding. So I need to at least spend a few hours working on this stuff today! Or maybe an hour...

    <h3>Basics of CSS</h3>
    <p>
        parent/child selectors seem very useful.  -->  .parent .child {property here} <br>

        Learned About: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Specificity <br>
                More specific will take priority 

            </li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            
        </ul>
