    <h1>February 5, 2022</h1>

    <div class="personal">
        <h2>Personal Stuff</h2>
        <p>
            I've still been playing a lot of Noita, but time to buckle down. There are just a few lessons I want to get through on Odin and then I think I will be better equipped for my work project. 

            <span class="musing" >I wonder what I'll have for lunch... </span>

            This is more text after the musing and it goes pack to the regular p styling. 
        </p>

    </div>
    

    <div class="business"> 
        <h2>Business Stuff</h2>
        <p> 
            This is an example of a business class. 

            <span class="musing">
                Styles will rever to regular page styles in this span because of the class declaration. 
            </span>

            And then continues afterwards. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Box Model</h3>
        <p>
            There are two kinds of boxes: Block boxes and Inline boxes

            <h4>Block Box</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Will break onto new line</li>
                <li>the box will fill 100% of its container</li>
                <li>width and height are respected</li>
                <li>padding, margin, border push other elements <b><u>away</u></b> from the box</li>

            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p>
            
        </p>

    </div>
